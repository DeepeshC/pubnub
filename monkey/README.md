# Monkey Multiplayer

Following from my previous thread where someone was talking about networking in monkey,
I spent a little time today getting pubnub working in html5 and flash!

It was incredibly straight forward,
and doesn't require anything special to be done
to your project files.
The required pubnub source and dom
elements are attached at runtime.

You can download the example + module here:

#### [update]

I tweaked the demo to use hard coded font colors
(seperate font for each color) and not apply any SetColor.
It is much faster now.

#### [update again]

I have now added a flash target to the module!
You can check the example and switch between
html5 and flash versions.
