Simple framework for pubnub.

1. Switch to terminal and run 'boot'. This action starts the discovery service.
2. Switch to other terminal and run 'loader.js'. This action will run all constollers.
3. Switch to other terminal and run 'loader.js'. 

So we have 1 instance for discovery service and 2 instances for each controllers (echo, time and translate).

4. Switch to other terminal and run from ./clients folder all tests.
